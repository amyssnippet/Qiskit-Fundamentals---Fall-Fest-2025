# the experience was good but for some cells like where the plots should be there it is not plotting and also some code snippets thrown errors, i guess it was due to version mismatch errors and i dont have an api key and crn so i cant perform the last cell too.

# Let us know if you’d like mentorship or guidance to learn more about Qiskit and quantum computing: Yeah Sure, i am ready


# 🧠 Qiskit Fundamentals

Welcome to **Qiskit Fundamentals** — a beginner-friendly notebook designed to help you explore the **basics of quantum computing** using **IBM’s Qiskit SDK**.

This notebook introduces key concepts such as:
- 🧩 Building and visualizing quantum circuits  
- ⚙️ Transpiling and optimizing for hardware  
- 🔬 Simulating with Qiskit Aer  
- 🚀 Running jobs on real IBM Quantum devices  
- 📊 Understanding Estimators and Runtime sessions
